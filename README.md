# A Microservice Reference Implementation in Golang
- To demonstrate a Web Service built using Golang

## Key Decisions
- [Go Kit](https://gokit.io/) being used a toolkit to avoid reinventing the wheel when it comes to 
RPC safety, system observability, infrastructure integration, and overall program design.
- Initial implementation is using REST as an interface (future support for gRPC)
